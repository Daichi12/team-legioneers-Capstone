# Getting started with the Express Server
This server folder was created using [Express] (https://github.com/expressjs/express/blob/master/Readme.md).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm test`
Runs the server on port 5000
The server will be listening to [http://localhost:5000].
The server will respond to the requests being made on the client side following the CRUD methodology.
Any changes being made on the server side will refresh the port that its listening to with said changes.
